This joke has no punchline.

I don't like math it talks about itself too much.

Peano's axioms:
(0-8) 	There was a relation, equality
		Reflexive, symmetric, transitility,
		A zero posessor,
		Injective successor,
		That misses the zero entirely.
(9)		If 0 is in X, and Sn is in X when n is in X, then X = N.

Historical facts:
(1899) Mathematical proofs kinda suck
(1900) Hilbert says "wow can we make these less sucky"
(1931) Godel says "no"
(1931) von Neumann says "it's over. it's done."

Our first-order of busininess is to answer the following questions.
(1) What is a sentence?
(2) Is this a sentence?
(3) Am I a sentence?
Answer to question (2):
Yes.
Answer to question (1)
